The syntax for the object is as follows:
  
the first field (i.e. typeObj[x][...][...]) resembles the damage multiplier for either "attack" or "defense"

the second field (i.e. typeObj[...][x][...]) resembles the 'from' type for attacks and 'to' type for defense.
the third field (i.e. typeObj[...][...][x]) resembles the 'to' type for attacks and 'from' type for defense.

For example:
typeObj["attack"]["ordinary"]["fire"] resembles the attack damage from an "ordinary" type to a "fire" type.
typeObj["defense"]["ordinary"]["fire"] resembles the defense multiplier that an "ordinary" type takes when being attacked by a "fire" type.
